## 180. Consecutive Numbers ##
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT DISTINCT
	log1.Num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM
	LOGS log1,
	LOGS log2,
	LOGS log3
WHERE
	log1.Id = log2.Id - 1
AND log2.Id = log3.Id - 1
AND log1.Num = log2.Num
AND log2.Num = log3.Num;
```
自联结查询
`SELECT DISTINCT log1.Num` 中的 `log1` 可替换为 `log2`, `log3`；
